# frontend

## Run Project

Ensure youa are in the frontend directory to run the Dream server and open the website in your local computer.

```sh
cd frontend/ 
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run server
```



When both processes are running, open a browser at http://localhost:3000.

We also have CI/CD, set up using Vercel, so the most up date version of our weba pp should be hosted
